1. Introduction:
  - Server.java is source code for event handling server. There are 2 threads running on this server:
		+> One thread always listens to event source , get the events and forward them to the correct clients based on the socketMapping
		+> The other always listens to clients user, add and keep the socket connection to clients in the socketMapping  
		
To simulator the system, I created more EventSource and UserClient:		
  - EventSource.java is source code for events source. It generates block of 4 events for each 2 seconds . By default , I set the number of block is 3.
  - UserClient.java is source code for user client. There are 3 clients with id : 1,2,3 . After create socket connections to server, they wait for the 
  forwarded event from server
  
2. Running the program:
  - Download the app.jar file to the folder
  
  - Run the server only, without event source and user clients:
      > java -jar app.jar serverOnly
	  
  - Run the server with simulation event source and user clients:
      > java -jar app.jar
